# Freb Fitness 🏋️‍♂️

**Freb Fitness** is a simple mobile fitness application developed as a clone of the "Abs in 30 Days" app. It was created as part of my SIWES (Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme) program for a local gym owned by my uncle. The app was my first complete attempt at building a mobile application using **Java**, **Android SDK**, and **SQLite**, and it focuses on delivering basic fitness features for beginners and gym-goers.

- 🧠 **Beginner-Friendly UI** – Straightforward layout for usability and practice
- 💾 **Local Storage** – Data stored using **SQLite** for offline capability
